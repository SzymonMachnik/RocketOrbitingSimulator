# 🚀 Rocket Orbiting Simulator
## 📃 Brief description
A simulator designed to model rocket movement within the framework of orbital mechanics. Built using the Unity game engine, it provides accurate visualizations and calculations of rocket trajectories by implementing the true laws of physics governing motion in space. This project leverages the power of C# and Unity to create an interactive experience for users.

## 🛠️ How it works? (Explanation from physics point of view)
### Moving on orbit

### Speed up to go slower, slow down to faster?

## 💻 Tech Stack
### Programming language:
  - C#.
### Engine:
  - Unity 6.
